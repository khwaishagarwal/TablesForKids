# TablesForKids
This project aims to create a fun and educational tool for kids to learn multiplication tables. The program generates multiplication tables from 1 to 20 and saves each table in a separate text file. All the files are organised and stored in a dedicated folder, making it easy for kids to access and use them for learning.
